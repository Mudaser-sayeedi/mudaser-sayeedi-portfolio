          <p>
            I am an experienced software developer. I bring more than three
            yearsâ€™ experience writing JavaScript full-stack Web-Applications and
            Mobile-Applications. Spearheaded successful transition from LAMP
            stack to MERN stack which cut latency by 40% and increased
            effectiveness of Database administrators by 20%.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a Full-Stack Developer who has a wide range of Front-End and
            Back-End skills, and extensive experience of using Object-Oriented
            languages. I really enjoy writing optimized Object-Oriented code and
            am very good at building and maintaining applications that support
            the solutions delivered to both internal and external customers. I
            always look to add my own magical touch to any new code that I
            write, and would like to mention that in the past I have worked
            alongside some very technically able individuals in the industry.
